# Building an AI-Powered Voice Assistant with Twilio and Pipecat: Complete Guide

Imagine having an AI assistant that can handle phone calls just like a human customer service representative. Today, we'll build exactly that – a sophisticated voice AI system that can both receive and make phone calls, powered by cutting-edge speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech technologies.

## What We're Building

Our AI voice assistant will be able to:

- 📞 Handle incoming phone calls automatically
- 📱 Make outbound calls to any phone number
- 🗣️ Have natural conversations using advanced AI
- 🎙️ Process speech in real-time with high accuracy
- 📊 Track and monitor call performance
- 🔄 Switch seamlessly between listening and speaking

The system is specifically designed for a Guest Relationship Executive at Compass Group (a foodservice company), but the architecture is flexible enough to adapt to any business use case.

## The Technology Stack

We're combining some of the best tools available today:

- **🌐 FastAPI**: Lightning-fast web framework for our API server
- **📞 Twilio**: World-class telephony infrastructure
- **🤖 Pipecat**: Powerful voice AI framework for real-time processing
- **🎯 OpenAI GPT**: Advanced language model for natural conversations
- **👂 Deepgram**: State-of-the-art speech-to-text recognition
- **🗣️ Cartesia**: High-quality text-to-speech synthesis
- **🔊 Silero VAD**: Voice activity detection for natural conversation flow

## Architecture Overview

Here's how all the pieces fit together:

```
Phone Call ➜ Twilio ➜ WebSocket ➜ Pipecat Pipeline ➜ AI Services
    ↑                                                      ↓
    ←────────── Audio Response ←──────────────────────────┘
```

The magic happens in the Pipecat pipeline, which processes audio in real-time:

1. **Audio Input**: Raw audio from the phone call
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Convert speech to text using Deepgram
3. **AI Processing**: Generate intelligent responses with OpenAI
4. **Text-to-Speech**: Convert AI responses back to natural-sounding speech
5. **Audio Output**: Send processed audio back to the caller

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before we dive in, you'll need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Twilio account with a phone number
- API keys for OpenAI, Deepgram, and Cartesia
- A way to expose your local server publicly (like ngrok)

### Installation

First, let's install all the required packages:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets
pip install pipecat-ai
pip install twilio python-dotenv pydantic
pip install loguru aiofiles
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with your API credentials:

```env
# Twilio Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

# AI Service Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key_here
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_key_here
CARTESIA_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id_here
```

## The Core Implementation

### 1. FastAPI Server (`server.py`)

Our server handles both incoming and outgoing calls:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, Request
from twilio.rest import Client

app = FastAPI()

# Handle incoming calls
@app.post("/")
async def handle_incoming_call():
    # Returns TwiML to start media streaming
    return HTMLResponse(content=twiml_template, media_type="application/xml")

# Make outbound calls
@app.post("/outbound")
async def make_outbound_call(request: OutboundCallRequest, req: Request):
    client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

    # Automatically detect the webhook URL from the current request
    base_url = f"{req.url.scheme}://{req.url.netloc}"

    call = client.calls.create(
        to=request.to_number,
        from_=twilio_number,
        url=f"{base_url}/outbound-twiml"
    )

    return {"success": True, "call_sid": call.sid}
```

### 2. AI Pipeline (`bot.py`)

The brain of our system is the Pipecat pipeline:

```python
from pipecat.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline
from pipecat.services.openai.llm import OpenAILLMService
from pipecat.services.deepgram.stt import DeepgramSTTService
from pipecat.services.cartesia.tts import CartesiaTTSService

# Create the AI pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    transport.input(),          # Audio from phone
    stt,                       # Speech-to-text
    context_aggregator.user(), # User context
    llm,                       # AI language model
    tts,                       # Text-to-speech
    transport.output(),        # Audio to phone
    audiobuffer               # Recording
])
```

## Key Features Explained

### 1. Dynamic Webhook URLs

One of the coolest features is automatic webhook URL detection. Instead of hardcoding URLs, the system automatically figures out where it's running:

```python
# No more manual configuration!
base_url = f"{req.url.scheme}://{req.url.netloc}"
webhook_url = f"{base_url}/outbound-twiml"
```

This means your app works whether you're running on:

- `http://localhost:8765` (development)
- `https://abc123.ngrok.io` (testing with ngrok)
- `https://yourapi.com` (production)

### 2. Smart Conversation Management

The AI assistant adapts its behavior based on call direction:

**For Incoming Calls:**

> "Hello! Thank you for calling Compass Group. I'm here to assist you with any feedback about our food and services. How can I help you today?"

**For Outbound Calls:**

> "Hello! This is calling from Compass Group's Guest Relations team. I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time. I'm calling to follow up on your recent experience with our services."

### 3. Real-time Audio Processing

The system processes audio in 8kHz chunks (Twilio's standard) with intelligent voice activity detection:

```python
# Configure for optimal performance
PipelineParams(
    audio_in_sample_rate=8000,
    audio_out_sample_rate=8000,
    allow_interruptions=True  # Natural conversation flow
)
```

### 4. Automatic Call Recording

Every conversation is automatically recorded with detailed metadata:

```python
filename = f"server_{port}_{direction}_recording_{timestamp}.wav"
```

Files are saved as standard WAV format for easy playback and analysis.

## Making Your First Call

### Outbound Call

Making an outbound call is as simple as a single API request:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8765/outbound" \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{"to_number": "+1234567890"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "call_sid": "CAxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "status": "queued",
  "to": "+1234567890",
  "from": "+0987654321",
  "webhook_url": "https://your-server.com/outbound-twiml"
}
```

### Monitoring Calls

Track any call's progress in real-time:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8765/call-status/CAxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

```json
{
  "call_sid": "CAxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "direction": "outbound-api",
  "duration": 45,
  "start_time": "2025-06-01T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Running the System
